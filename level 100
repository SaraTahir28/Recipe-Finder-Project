Goal: Fetch recipes from your backend and display them as cards in the resultsDiv.

Guided steps/questions:

Fetching the data

You already have your fetch working.

After getting the JSON, how will you store the results in your results array?

Creating a card function

How would you write a createRecipeCard(recipe) function that returns a div element with:

Recipe name (p)

Image (img)

Appending to the DOM

How will you loop over results and append each card to resultsDiv?

Donâ€™t forget: what should you do to resultsDiv before adding new cards to avoid stacking old results?
